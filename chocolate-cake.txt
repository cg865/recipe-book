Chocolate Cake:

Ingredients:
1 ¾ cups (220g) all-purpose flour

1 ½ cups (300g) granulated sugar

¾ cup (75g) unsweetened cocoa powder

2 tsp baking powder

1 tsp baking soda

½ tsp salt

2 eggs

1 cup (240ml) milk

½ cup (120ml) vegetable oil or melted butter

2 tsp vanilla extract

1 cup (240ml) boiling water

Instructions:
Preheat the oven

Set your oven to 350°F (175°C).

Grease and flour two 9-inch (23 cm) round cake pans.

Prepare the dry ingredients

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.

Mix the wet ingredients

Add the eggs, milk, oil (or butter), and vanilla extract to the dry mixture.

Beat on medium speed for about 2 minutes until smooth.

Add boiling water

Slowly pour in the boiling water while stirring. The batter will be thin—this is normal!

Bake the cake

Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans.

Bake for 30–35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.

Cool and serve

Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack.

Once cooled, frost with chocolate frosting or dust with powdered sugar.
